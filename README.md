Stream a url to a target DOM element.

## Backdrop

In the year 2022/5783/Tiger/2076/2014/47, all browsers have become [stream capable](https://caniuse.com/streams) (ðŸŽ‰), in the context of an already opened HTML page.  This opens a huge number of doors as far as new approaches to building applications.  However, declarative support is not there yet, so this is one of many (I'm sure) attempts to fill the gap.

## Syntax

```html
<div be-written=https://html.spec.whatwg.org></div>
```

... streams the contents of https://html.spec.whatwg.org into the div.

The syntax above is shorthand for:

```html
<div be-written='{
    "from": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/",
    "to": ".",
    "reqInit": {},
    "beBased": true
}'>
```

If "to" is ".", be-written  writes directly to its (shadow) children.

reqInit is the second optional parameter of fetch.

beBased indicates to enable rewriting url's coming from third parties.  Having it set to true (the default), does impose something of a performance cost, so set it to false if that works okay.

## What about security?

Security is a particularly thorny issue for this component, and is one of the many slam dunk reasons this functionality really should be built into the browser, with proper security mechanisms in place.  In particular, the ability to filter out script tags and other dangerous HTML is nearly impossible with the currently available, cross-browser api's, afaik.  So if the stream contains script tags or other such syntax, it will be written with no interference.

In the absence of any signs of mercy from the w3c, we apply security thusly:

1.  be-written has support for import maps, and also for url resolving via link tags (preload attribute) having attribute onblur [TODO].
2.  Since import maps require the web page to specify things inside a script tag, and onblur attributes are things which are filtered out from any DOM purification / sanitizing, we can rely on this to assume that if a path is specified by either an import map or a link preload tag with an onblur attribute, the site has given a green light for content coming from that url.
3.  Thus, be-rewritten provides rudimentary support for import maps, and for url resolving via link preload tags. 
4.  Not only does be-rewritten provide this rudimentary support, it **requires** that the path be "endorsed" by one or both of these mechanisms.  

So in fact the example shown above will not work. 

To make it work, do one of the following:

```html
<head>
    <!--doesn't have to be in the head tag, but it's probably where it should go -->
    <script type=importmap>
        {
            "imports": {
                "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/"
            }
        }
    </script>
</head>
...
<div be-written='{
    "from": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/",
    "to": ".",
    "reqInit": {},
    "beBased": true
}'>
```

and/or:

```html
<head>
    <link id="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" rel=preload as=fetch href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" onblur=x>
</head>
...
<div be-written='{
    "from": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/",
    "to": ".",
    "reqInit": {},
    "beBased": true
}'>
```

> **Note**:  This web component is a member of the [be-decorated](https://github.com/bahrus/be-decorated) family of element decorators / behaviors.  As such, it can also become active during [template instantiation](https://github.com/bahrus/trans-render#extending-tr-dtr-horizontally), though my head spins even thinking about it.

> **Note**:   By streaming content into the live DOM Document, it is quite possible the browser will find itself performing multiple page reflows.  Be sure to use the Chrome Dev tools (for example) | rendering | web vitals to watch for any performance issues.  Various CSS approaches can be employed to minimize this:

1.  [content-visibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility)
2.  [contain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain)
3.  [overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) - worst case?

> **Note**:  be-written tries its best to adjust url's as needed, but mileage may vary, depending on the browser and the time of day (?) as far as avoiding premature downloads.  One of the key [missing platform pieces](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-base-attribute-to-specify-base-url-for-relative-urls-contained-within/6064), in my opinion.

> **Note**:  For even more aggressive re-writing, see [be-rewritten](https://github.com/bahrus/be-rewritten) (WIP), which is (partly) a stop-gap for [this proposal](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-support-cloudflares-htmlrewriter-api-in-workers/5721).

> **Note**:  For importing HTML optimized for HTML-first web components, see [be-importing](https://github.com/bahrus/be-importing).

> **Note**:  To be HTML5 compliant, use data-be-written for the attribute name instead.


## With Shadow DOM

```html
<details be-written='{
    "from": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/",
    "to": "div",
    "shadowRoot": "open"
}'>
    <summary>HTML Specs</summary>
    <div></div>
</details>
```

## Between

A crude filter can be applied to the streamed content:

```JavaScript
"between": ["<!--begin-->", "<!--end-->"]
```

It is crude because the way the text streams, it is possible that the sought after string spans across two consecutive chunks.  To make the chances of this breaking anything approach nill, repeat the search string twice:

```html
<template shadowroot="open"><!--begin--><!--begin-->
    ...
<!--end--><!--end--></template>
```

## URL Mapping via link preload tags

The "from" parameter can also be the id of a link tag.  If that is the case, the url that is fetched comes from the href property of the link tag.

## Support for import maps

*be-written* also supports rudimentary url substitution based on import maps:

```html
<script type=importmap>{
    "imports":{
        "xtal-side-nav/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/xtal-side-nav@0.0.104/"
    }
}</script>
<xtal-side-nav be-written=xtal-side-nav/xtal-side-nav.html></xtal-side-nav>

```



> **Note**:  The [json-in-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andersonbruceb.json-in-html#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20json-in-html%20supports%20editing%20json%20within%20html,which%20often%20make%20heavy%20use%20of%20JSON-serialized%20attributes.) vs-code plugin makes editing JSON attributes like this much more pleasant / natural.

## Styling

By default, *be-written* adds class "be-written-in-progress" to the element it adorns while the streaming is in progress.

The name of the class can be explicitly set ("inProgressCss": "whatever-you-want").

## Inserts

Because it may be critical to provide custom styling within the shadow DOM (like content-visibility / contains mentioned above), *be-written* provides the ability to slip in a cloned template into the Shadow DOM before the streaming starts.  Likewise, it may be useful to insert some content after - for example providing a link / acknowledgment from where the content came from.

Here's how to insert content:

```html
<div be-written='{
    "from": "blah.html",
    "inserts": {
        "before": "<div>before</div>",
        "after": "<div>after</div>"
    }
}'></div>
```

## Notification when finished

When the streaming has finished, the element adorned by the be-written decorator emits event: "be-decorated.written.resolved".

## Lazy Loading

*be-written* already has some lazy-loading built in -- the decorator only becomes activated when the element it adorns has been rendered (so if it is inside a details element, it will not stream until the details element is expanded).

But it does start streaming even if the element is well outside the viewable area.

For true lazy loading, set "defer" to true, and adorn the element with the [be-oosoom](https://github.com/bahrus/be-oosoom) attribute:

```html
<div be-oosoom be-written='{
    "from": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/",
    "defer": true
}'></div>
```
