Stream a url to a target element.

```html
<div be-written=https://html.spec.whatwg.org></div>
```

... streams the contents of https://html.spec.whatwg.org into the div.

The syntax above is shorthand for:

```html
<div be-written='{
    "from": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/",
    "to": ".",
    "reqInit": {},
}'>
```

If "to" is ".",  writes directly to its light children.

reqInit is the second optional parameter of fetch.

```html
<details be-written='{
    "from": "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/",
    "to": "div",
    "shadowRoot": "open"
}'>
    <summary>HTML Specs</summary>
    <div></div>
</details>
```
